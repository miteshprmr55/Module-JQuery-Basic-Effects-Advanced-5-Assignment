            -> jQuery is a lightweight, "write less, do more", JavaScript library. The purpose of jQuery is to make it
               much easier to use JavaScript on your website. jQuery takes a lot of common tasks that require many lines
               of JavaScript code to accomplish, and wraps them into methods that you can call with a single line of code.

            -> JQuery simplifies the code to interact with HTML elements in documents, handle events, create animations,
               and develop AJAX applications.   
   
            -> jQuery is used by 94.5% of all the websites whose JavaScript library we know. This is 77.3% of all websites.
